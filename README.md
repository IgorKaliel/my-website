## My website!

I am a Frontend Developer with a Bachelor of Information Systems in Faculty Impact Technology from SÃ£o Paulo and more than 5 years of software development experience.

I am experienced in web development with Open Sources technologies using Node, Reactjs and Nextjs. I have working experience with Model View Controller (MVC), and have been working with server side rendering to get more performance in Lighthouse and index pages on search engines. I have also designed and developed web user controls, master pages, validation controls, CSS files using technologies like Styled Components, SCSS,  ChakraUI and Tailwind.

When working on a new project or digital product, I like to speak with my clients so that I can have a clear understanding of their business rules and all the process. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to working with you soon.
